## Interactions with Matter
Infra Red photons interact with covalent bonds in molecules promoting the bonds (or the electrons within the bonds) to higher vibrational energy levels. Vibrational levels involve bond stretching and bond bending, in which the size of the bond dipole moment is altered. Bonds with a zero dipole moment cannot be excited by Infra Red waves. 


>NOTE: The electronic component of the IR radiation is involved in the interaction, not the magnetic.

### Mathematical Model  
As bond stretching is being considered Hooke's law which gives the frequency of oscillation for a spring, can be used as an approximation, that is: \newline 

$v=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}$\newline 
$\rightarrow \bar{\nu}=\frac{1}{2\pi c}\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}$\newline 
 Where: \newline 
>$k$= The force constant. \newline 
>$\mu=\frac{m_xm_y}{m_x+m_y}$= The reduced mass (C-C:6.0, C-H: 0.92)\newline
>$m_x, m_y$ = Atomic mass of compounds x and y respectively. 

From Hooke's law it can be seen that: \newline 
$\bar{\nu}\propto k^\frac{1}{2}$
