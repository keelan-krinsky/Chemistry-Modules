# Absorbance
Absorbance is a measure of the extent to which a substance transmits electromagnetic radiation. 

## Equation 
Absorbance (A) is defined by equation to as: \newline 

$A=-\text{log}_{10}$. ($=\text{log}_{10}(\frac{I_0}{I})$)\newline 

Where:\newline 
> $T$ =Transmittance. 
> $I_0$ = Intensity of incident radiation and 
> $I$ = Intensity of transmitted radiation.
