# Electromagnetic Radiation

## Wave nature. 
Electromagnetic waves consist of and electric and magnetic field which oscillate orthogonally to each other, and orthogonally to the direction of propagation of the wave. 

## Wavelength 
Wavelength is donated by $\lambda$ and measured in meters.

>NOTE: It is sometime convenient to use nanometres rather than meters when expressing wavelengths related to ultra violet or visible light.  

## Velocity 
Speed is donated by $c$. The speed of light in a vacuum ($c_0$) is constant ($3.00 \cdot 10^{8}m\cdot s^{-1}$), normally the speed of light is given in $m\cdot s^{-1}$ 

## Frequency
Frequency is donated by $\nu$ and is measured in Hertz (Hz) that is $s^{-1}$
 
## Wavenumber  
Wavenumber is donated by $\overline{\nu}$, and is the reciprocal of wavelength. It is measured in $cm^{-1}$ and used most commonly in IR spectra. 

## Particle nature.
Photons are particles of light. There particles posses a distinct quantised energy given by $E=h\nu$
