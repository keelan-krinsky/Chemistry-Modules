## Physical Properties

### Density
The density of water is dependant on physical state, which in turn is dependant on temperature. 

#### Variation with Temperature 
At atmospheric temperature water is most dense at around $4^\circ C$. Below this temperature density decreases as molecular space increases as the molecules begin to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure in the formation of ice. Above this temperature the density decreases, as the average intermolecular space increases due to increased kinetic energy of the water molecules. Above $100^\circ C$ density decreased sharply as water boils to form water vapour. Vapour density decreases rapidly with increasing temperature.

### Heat Capacity 
Water has a very high heat capacity for such a small molecule due to its ability to hydrogen bond.
