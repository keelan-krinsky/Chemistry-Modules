# Vibrational Energy Levels
Vibrational energy levels can be associated with change in bond length (stretching) or bond angle (bending), stretching requires more energy than bending, (i.e a higher wavenumber).

## Normal modes of vibration 
Independent combinations of vibrational motion are called normal modes of vibration. There are six normal modes of vibration, namely: Symmetrical stretching, asymmetrical stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging, and twisting. 

### Symmetrical stretching 	

### Asymmetrical stretching. 

### Scissoring

### Rocking 

### Wagging 

### Twisting. 

## Polyatomic molecules
Neighboring bonds in a molecule influence each other changing the vibrational energy levels associated with each bond. This effect can be cumulative.
