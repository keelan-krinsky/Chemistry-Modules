>>The reaction will proceed through the more stable intermediates to form the major porduct (which is in some cases the sole product. regioselectivity is a process whereby more than one product is possible in a reactino but only one producit is formed or products are formed disproportionately, this process follows markovnikov addition.

>>the bromine radical will attch the alkene, by attacking either side. 
>>
>>radicals are electron poor species. and so the more stable radical will be higher substituted, due to the electron donating alkyl groups. 
>>so regioselectivity will now favour the opposite product with the halogen on the primary carbon. another bromide is not normally added becuse the hydrogen radical is far less stable than the bromide radical (write out the general rule in terms of which one is added because of radical stability). 
>>
> >### Addition ofA $Br_2$
>>although the bond is non polar the electrons in it are highly polerisable (due to large atoms) due to the formation a delta postive charge on one bromine which can act as a electrophile, to interact wit the double bond nucleophile. 
>>
>>the reactivity of alkenes is relant on the weakness of $\pi$ bonds relatrive to $\sigma bonds$ so saturated compounds tend to be more stable. 
>>
>>in the intermediate one of the lone paris on the bromine froms a bond to the adjacent cation to form a bromonium cation, (which is more stable). the $Br^-$ anoin can now add to the bromonium cation (it always adds to the opposite face of the molecule to where the inital bromine is, due to steric hinderance), (both sterics and electrons are playing a role bu the effect is predominately steric dirven. 
>>
>>however in a saturated system, where there is free addition then which face is added to does not matter, addition in a ring however bromine will add on oppoistes of the ring, one above and one below the plane of the ring, and so a trans product will be produced.). 
>>
>>
> >## reaction of hydrogen with double bonds
>>
>>the H-H bond is weakened by addhesion onto the platinum or paladium surface, the exact mechanism is not completely known, it is known that syn addition of H across the double bond occurs (i.e the two hydrogen add to the same side of the double bond )
>>the hydrogen, this is because the H-H bond is not long enough  for them to add on opposite sides, to reduce an alkyne to an alkene a posioned catalysted (posioned with some lead). alkynes undergo most of the same reactions but slower, both because of a very stable vinyl cation intermediate formed, and becuase the $C\equiv C$ trible bond is actually slightly stronger than the double bond.

> >### Oxonolysis
>>the $\pi$ bond gives its electrons to an outside oxygen neutralaisingf the chargew on the central oxone atom an intermediate is formed known as molozonie, moloxonide rearranges to form an ozonde. write out reaction with arrows. which can occur with $Zn/AlOH$ or $Me_2S$, the products are ketones and aldehydes, in an aromatic ring other double bonds will be cleaved before double bond, but if left for sufficent time then aromatic edouble bonds will also cleave. the advantage is that, as it is difficult to stop the oxidation of a primary alcohol at the aldehyde stage, oxonolysis gives an alternative.
>>
>>the collapse of the oxonide to the aldehydes/ketones (the mecahnism with dimethyl sulphide is known, the Zonc mecahnism is less well understood).
>>
>>an excess of oxone is used as working out exactly how much oxone is added can be quite difficult. carbon carbaon doulbe bonds are replaced with carbon oxyugen double bonds. in generak carbon carbon double bonds are replsaced by csrbon oxygfen double bonds

># Heteroatom Compounds

> ># Saturated Heteroatom Compounds
>>A heteroatom is any atom aside from Carbon and hydrogen, a heteroatom compound is a compound containing at least one heteroatom. 
>>
> >### Bond polarisation
>>If the heteroatom is more electronegative the carbon to which it is bonded will carry a delta positive charge. Where the heteroatom is less electronegative (such as with metals) the carbon to which it is bonded will carry a delta negative charge.
>>
>>
>>>NOTE: Organic compounds are compounds containing both carbon and hydrogen. 
>>

>>
>>C-X (F,Cl,Br,I)
>>
> >#### oxygen
>>
>>Alcohols (primary secondary and tertiary), ethers.
>>
> >#### sulphur
>>thiols 
>>sulfides
>>
> >#### nitrogen
>>primary, secondary and tertiary amines. 
>>
> >### Reactivity
>>Compounds contains a electrophilic carbon usually react with nucleophiles, whereas compounds containing nucleophilic carbons will react with electrophiles. The lone pairs on heteroatoms allow them to act as proton acceptors (lewis bases).C-X bond (Cl(326), O(351),N(366)) are much weaker than C-H bonds (413)
>>
> >### Acid base properties
>>
>>Alcohols can release protons from the O-H bond, so can act as acids but are often very weak. Ethers on the other hand have no acidic proteins so cannot act as acids. Primary and secondary amines can also act as acids donating protons attached tot he nitrogen. 
>>
>>Alcohols will react with metals to from a metal hydrate and an alkyloxide.
>>
> >### Basic behaviour
>>alcohols can accept protons due to the lone pairs on oxygen forming an oxonium ion. Amines can also act as bases accepting protons with the lone pair of the nitrogen. 
>>
> >### Substitution reactions
>>saturated heteroatoms will undergo substitution reactions for example the substitution of a halogen with by a $OH^-$ ion.
>>Substitution and elimination always compete with each other. In principle, this process is reversible so to favour the forward reaction a good nucleophile should be a poor leaving group. And a good leaving group should be a poor nucleophile. 
>>
> >### Nucleophile strength
>>A good nucleophile tends to be a good base. (the aspect of nucleophilicity is governed by the electron distribution of the molecule) Full negative charge implies better base and hence better nucleophile. This also implies that more highly substituted nucleophiles will be better nucleophiles due to the electron releasing alkyl group. 
>>
> >#### Down a group
>>moving down a group nucleophilicity increases (although basicity decreases). Electrons on atoms further down experience less effective nuclear charge so are more readily donated. 
>>Copy table
>>
> >### Moving across a period electronegativity decreases, as the more electronegative atoms hold onto their electrons more strongly and so donate them less readily.
> >### Leaving groups
>>The weaker the C-X bond the better the leaving group. For anions normally the weakest bases are the best leaving groups. 
>>Groups which can from resonance structures are better leaving groups as they are more stable. OH is a very poor leaving group (COPY TABLE)
>>To displace OH groups they must be pronated to form water. For example $NaBr$ cannot replace OH but $HBr$ can as the OH group is first pronated becoming a better leaving group. 
>>
>>> NOTE: As a weak acid implies strong conjugate and visa versa the acidity of the conjugate acids of two nucleophiles can be compared to determine the relative strengths. 
>>
>>> Flow of electrons and transition states and well as stereochemical features must be considered. 
>>
> >### Elimination vs substitution
>>The more basic the nucleophile the more likely it is to undergo elimination rather than substitution. In a substitution reaction the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite the carbon.
>>
> >### Temperature
>>Higher temperature will favour elimination.
>>
>>this is because in the elimination reaction there are more products than reactant is to entropy increases, so as T increases $T\Delta S$ increases and $\Delta G$ decreases making the reaction more spontaneous.
>>
> >#### Size
>>The more bulky/branched the substrate the more likely elimination is to occur as substitution is sterically hindered. 
>>A large nucleophile will also promote elimination due to steric considerations.
>>
>>>NOTE:there is a fundamental difference between nucleophiles and bases. Nucleophiles are defined kinetically, i.e. the strength of a nucleophile is related to how fast it will react. Bases are related to thermodynamics, i.e. how strong the bonds formed will be. 
>>
> >### $S_N$ reactions
>>nucleophilic substitution reaction
>>
> >#### Leaving group
>>Good leaving group promotes reaction.
>>
>>
> >#### $S_N1$
>>Unimolecular
>>
>>In the $S_N1$ reaction the leaving group leaves before the nucleophile attacks. Two step process proceeding via a carbocation intermediate. The Rate of the reaction is dependant one reactant. Weaker nucleophiles prefer the $S_N1$. Only one reactant in the rate ordering step. Second order Kinetics, two reactants are involved. 
>>
> >##### Energy Profile of Reaction
>>Contains two humps,as two steps, between the two humps is the energy carbocation intermediate. 
>>
> >##### Stereochemistry
>>A carbocation is $sp^2$ hybridised with a trigonal planar. As the nucleophile can attack from either side a racemic mixture is produced. 
>>
> >##### Effect of nucleophile
>>The nucleophile has no effect on the rate
>>
> >#### $S_N2$
>>Bimolecular
>>The nucleophile attacks and the leaving group leaves simultaneously. The rate of the reaction is dependant on the concentration of both reactants.Stronger nucleophile prefers the $S_N2$ reaction.
>>
> >##### Intermediate Stability
>>The more stable the intermediates (i.e. the carbocation), the more likely $S_N1$ reaction is to occur. 
>>
> >##### Stereochemistry
>>The nucleophile approaches the molecule from the opposite charge from the leaving group, which leads to inversion of the current stereochemistry around the central carbon. By default tertiary carbocation will normally undergo $S_N1$ reactions. 
>>
> >##### Steric Hindrance
>>As other groups bonded to the positively charged carbon of the carbocation then there will be more steric hindrance hence carbocation are favoured by secondary carbon cations. By default primary carbocation will normally undergo $S_N2$ reactions.
>>
> >##### $S_N2$
>>Good nucleophiles promote $SN_2$ reactions.
>>
> >#### Protic solvents
>>Protic solvents promote $S_N1$ by stabilising (through donation of charge from high electron density areas of surrounding solvent molecules) the Carbocation. Water and methanol are good protic solvents, an hydration shell is formed. 
>>
> >### Base induced elimination
>>The nucleophile acts as a base attacking the hydrogen, dependant on the reactant structure different products are possible. The major product formed will be dictated by the stability of carbocation. Zietzef's rule. Geometric isomers may be formed, the trans isomer will be more stable as there is less steric hindrance. 
>>

> ># Unsaturated Heteroatom Compounds
>>
> >## Electronic Structure
>>the delta negative nucleophile is in the $\pi$ bond, however with heteroatoms this bond is still polar. 
>>
> >## Reactions
>>
> >### Strong  Nucleophile
>>If a strong nucleophile is used then the nucleophile atoms will donate before the $\pi$ atoms of the substrate. A grignard reagent is used to obtains a carbon nucleophile. This nucleophile can attach the carbon of the heteroatom double/triple bond to form an organic oxonium ion in a salt with the remainder of the grignard reagent. This salt is stickily and prone to hydrolysis so is usually worked up to an alcohol for storage of further reaction.
>>
>>Grignard reagent made by an insertion reaction between an alkyl bromide and magnesium.
>>
> >#### Hydride nucleophile
>>
> >##### Reagents.
>>The hydride will attack the electrophilic carbon and the resulting oxonium ion will take a hydrogen from a water. There reagent are used in preference of hydrogen gas with a catalyst as they are cheaper, and in some instances may reaction more specifically (not interfere with the rest of the molecule) where $H_2$ gas would.
>>
> >###### $NaBH_4$ Sodium borohydride
>>Cannot reduce esters or amide (weaker reducing agent than $LiAlH_4$)
>>
> >###### $LiAlH_4$ Lithium aluminium hydride
> >### Weak nucleophile
>>Typical weak nucleophiles include $H_2O$, $ROH$, $RSH$. Catalyst required with, $H^+$ addition to the oxygen leading to a resonance structure in which the charge on the carbon has increased (the electrophile has been activated), so it is more reactive. 
>>
>>
>>This reactions may be reversible. 
>>
> >#### Acetal Formation
>>requires the addition of two alcohol equivalents to an aldehyde. 
>>
>>Some reactions involve masking a functional group for example with a acetyl,performing the reaction, and then unmasking it. 
>>
>>Addition of an alcohol leads to O addition to the electrophilic carbon to form a hemiacetal intermediate. Theses intermediates are highly unstable, with the OH of the newly formed alcohol protonating, and water removing as a leaving group. All of the reactions involved however are equilibria. The second equivalent of the alcohol then adds to the electrophilic carbon to form an acetal.
>>
>>Sometimes with a diol formation of a cyclic acetyl compound will occurs
>>
>>
>>>NOTE: the second alcohol may also be protonated and deprotonation but no reaction follows from this protonation. 
>>>NOTE: protonation and deprotonation occurs constantly in solution. 
>>> NOTE: Protonation exists as an equilibrium 
>>> NOTE: Do not confuse equilibrium with resonance arrows. 
>>
>>Substitution
>>Addition followed by elimination leads to an overall substitution, where for example an carboxylic acid can be attacked by an amine, Acid catalysis typically is required to protonated the oxygen afterwards, and the elimination of water to form a imine. The reaction only works for primary amines. $N-HH_2$ forms a hydrazone, and $N-OH$ forms a oxime. 
>>
> >### Aldol reactions
>>enolate ions formed by deprotonation by a base. Enolate ions the dimerisize by donation from the nucleophilic carbon on one to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon on the other, the $\pi$ bond of the carbonyl group breaks and an intermediate oxygen anion is then formed. Which can be protonated by water, regenerating the $OH^-$ 
>>base (which acts as a catalyst). Typically in the presence of the base regenerated the reaction proceeds one step further where the base deprotonates an acidic proton to form an enolate ion, $OH^-$ will then leave forming a conjugated aldehyde. If water is added at this point the reaction will be quenched and will not proceed. The stability of the aldol will determine its propensity to undergo dehydration. 
>>
>>Protons alpha to a carbonyl are acidic and hence may be removed by base. 
>>
>>
>>>NOTE: different from the keto enol transition as it is an elimination not just a proton shift. 
>>
>>> NOTE: selectivity issues may arise due to base deprotonation other acidic protons, and sometimes formation of side products.
