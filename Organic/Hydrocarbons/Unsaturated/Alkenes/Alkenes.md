### Reactions

Unsymmetrical alkene, requires ant-Markovnikov addition, reaction with $Br^\cdot$, 
bromonation requires reaction with liquid bromine. forms a bromium cation leading to steric hiderance, and 

hydroenation uses metal catalyst, palladium or platinum, leads to cis addition. 
formation or carboxy products from alkenes is oxonolysis. 

osmium tetrozide, leads to cis addition.
