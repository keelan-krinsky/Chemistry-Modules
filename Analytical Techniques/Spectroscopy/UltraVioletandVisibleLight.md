# Ultra Violet and Visible Light Spectroscopy

## Background

### __Ultra Violet: Ultra Violet: Interactions with Matter__

### __Visible Light: Visible Light: Interactions with Matter__

## Interpretation of Spectrogram 

### $\lambda_{max}$ 
For a given peak the lambda max value is wavelength at which the peak reaches its highest point, i.e. the wavelength at which the maximum absorbance is observed. 

### $\epsilon_{max}$
