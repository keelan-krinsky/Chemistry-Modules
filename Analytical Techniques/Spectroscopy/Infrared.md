# Infrared
Interact with bond stretch, affecting vibrational energy levels. 

## Process

## __Infra Red: Infra Red: Interactions with Matter__


The larger the change induced in the dipole moment the stronger the signal generated. If the bond is symmetrical then there will be no IR signal, as no IR radiation will be absorbed.

## Application 

## Interpretation of Spectrograph
 In a spectrograph absorbance is plotted against wavenumber. The absorbance spectra seen in a spectrograph results from the distinct absorbance of different bonds at different frequencies of incident Infra Red waves.

### Qualitative information 

#### Important Bonds. 
The most important bonds in IR are the bonds that stretch more or less independently of the rest of the molecule. Such bonds are bonds that are much weaker or stronger than neighboring bonds within the molecule. Bonds in which one atom is much heavier than the other also tend to have strong and distinctive absorption patterns. 

### Functional Groups
Different functional groups have very characteristic IR absorption signals, so the functional groups present in a compound can be inferred from its IR spectrograph. The average positions of many functional groups are listed in correlation tables/charts. 

### Quantitative information
Infrared spectra can be used to obtain quantitative information about the strength and length of bonds. This information is  calculated using force constants. 

### Peak Classification. 
Peaks are generally grouped into one of four categories based on the extent of absorption which they imply: very strong, strong, medium, and weak. Peaks may be further described as either sharp or broad depending on the range of wavelengths which are absorbed by interactions with the bond. 

### Peak position. 
The $\bar{\nu}$ at the lowest point of a peak is taken as the position of that peak.

The section of the spectra from $1500-400-cm^{-1}$ is generally focused on as peaks in this region are easier to resolve. In the fingerprint region many overlapping weaker peaks makes it far more difficult to identify specific bonds. 

### Operating range. 
A IR spectra is typically taken over a range of $400-4000cm^{-1}$ ($\lambda=2.5 \cdot 10^{-6}- 2.5 \cdot 10^{-5}$) 

#### Stretching vibrations.
Peaks corresponding to bond stretch are normally found within the $4000-1500cm^{-1}$ region of the spectrograph. 

##### __Vibrational Energy Level: Vibrational Energy Levels__


#### Bending
Peaks corresponding to bond bending are normally found in the $\overline{\nu}<1500cm^{-1}$ region of the spectrograph. 
Bending or stretching of C-X bonds, other than C-H are normally found here, such as C-O stretches and C-F or C-Cl. 

>NOTE: This region is known as the fingerprint region as is useful in matching spectra to the spectra for compounds of known identity. 

## Application 
IR spectra are very useful for identifying the functional groups present in an organic compound of unknown identity. The can also be used to obtain quantitative measures of bond strength and length. 

### Measuring Devices
The Infrared radiation used is obtained from a heated coil. This radiation passes through the sample before arriving at the detector. Some of the incident radiation is diverted to a interferometer which producer a interferogram for the source radiation. This interferogram is decoded by furrier transfer. On its way to the sample the incident beam passes through a specially shaped (normally diamond) crystal to allow for attenuated total reflection (ATR).
