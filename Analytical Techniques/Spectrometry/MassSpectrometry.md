# Mass Spectrometry

## Resolution 

### High resolution 
High resolution mass spectra can distinguishing between different molecular formula of similar compound.

## Interpretation of Spectrograph
Each line observed on the spectrograph corresponds to a different charged fragment. The consistency of these fragmentation patterns makes them diagnostic, allowing the identity of the sample to be inferred from the fragmentation pattern observed.

### Relative abundance
The abundance of ions implied by the height of each peak is measured relative to the largest peak in the spectrograph which is given a value of 100\%. 

### Parent Ion
The parent will have the same mass as the largest radical mass fragments.

>NOTE: The average molecular mass should not be used for Mass spectrography analysis, as each peak corresponds to a compound consisting of specific isotopes of each atom, and not a waited average and not a waited average following the general distribution of isotopes. 

### Multiply charged fragments
Doubly,or higher charged fragments resulting from the removal of more than one electron from a given fragment are always possible, however they are very rare in the fragmentation of small molecules, as their high charge density implies that they are highly unstable. 

### Isotopic Fragments
The specific isotope composition of a fragment leads to slightly larger or smaller charge density for that fragment. The relative high of peaks corresponding to different isotopic forms can also be diagnostic, as it is expected to follow the general isotopic distribution for the atoms involved. 

#### Carbon 13
$^{13}C$ atoms make up about 1.1\% of all carbon atoms, with the remainder almost exclusively $^{12}C$. Therefore the probability of a given fragment containing one or more $^{13}C$ atom can be calculated using a binomial distribution, for N number of carbon atoms in the fragments, and a $0.011$ probability of a given carbon atom being a $^{13}C$ isotope.

#### Bromine
$^{^81}Br$ atoms make up about 50\% of all Bromine atoms, with the remainder almost exclusively $^{79}Br$. Therefore the probability of a given fragment containing one or more ${81}^Br$ atom can be calculated using a binomial distribution, for N number of Bromine atoms in the fragments, and a $0.50$ probability of a given Bromine atom being a $^{81}Br$ isotope.

#### Chlorine
$^{^37}Br$ atoms make up about 25\% of all Bromine atoms, with the remainder almost exclusively $^{35}Cl$. Therefore the probability of a given fragment containing one or more ${35}^Cl$ atom can be calculated using a binomial distribution, for N number of Chlorine atoms in the fragments, and a $0.25$ probability of a given Chlorine atom being a $^{81}Br$ isotope.

## Fragmentation patterns. 
The pattern of fragmentation seen is determined by the stability of the cation fragments, as well as the energy implied in their formation. The fragmentation patterns occurring during ionisation are consistent for a given compound, relating to the strength of bonds in the compound.

C-C bonds are weaker than C-H bonds so cleavage is far more likely to occur at C-C bonds than at C-H bonds.
