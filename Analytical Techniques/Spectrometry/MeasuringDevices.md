Many mass spectrometers are desktop sized. 

## Gas Cromatographers. 
Gas cromatographers are often combined with a mass spectrometer, in which the beam of ions output from the spectrometer are fed directly into the gas cromatographers, and analysed by their retention time in the chromatography coil. 


## Process

### Stage 1 (Ionization)
A beam of high-energy particles, $\approx 70eV=6700kJ\cdot mol^{-1}$, (usually electrons), is incident onto the molecular sample. These high energy particles dislodged valence electron from the sample molecules, leaving behind a radical cation. \newline

$M:\rightarrow M^{+}_\cdot +e^-$. 

Further fragmentation can occur at this point. Lone pair, $\sigma$ or $\pi$ bonds can be dislodged and the parent ion can break down further producing both charged and neutral fragments.

/newline 

$M^{+\bullet}\rightarrow X^{\bullet}+Y^+$

More stable cations are more likely to form, and sustain during the process. 

### Stage 2 (Acceleration) 
The ions formed are then accelerated to a uniform speed, through a positively charged chamber by the application of a perpendicular magnetic field. The positively charged forces the cations into a tight beam, which passes through a slit at the end of the chamber. The walls of the plate which contains the slit are maintained in an uncharged state ( $0V$) so as not to repel or attract the cations. 

>NOTE: The perpendicular magnetic field is perpendicular to the desired line of motion of the molecular cations. 

### Step 3 (Deflection)
The beam of cations is deflection is a curved path by a magnetic field. The extent of deflection is dependant on both the mass charge ratio. The deflected beam passes through an exit slit and on to the detector. Particles defected too much or too little will not pass through the exit slit, instead hitting the walls of the chamber.
